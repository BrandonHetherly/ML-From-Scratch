### Linear Regression
- temp

### Logistic Regression
- I use gradient descent for optimization
- Accuracy scores differ between models:
  - Sklearns model does not use gradient descent
  - Sklearn defaults to L2 regularization (Ridge), which is not present in the class (I will add regularization in the future)

### KNN
- temp

### Naive Bayes
- Assumes all features are mutually independent
- Assumes all features follow a Gaussian distribution
